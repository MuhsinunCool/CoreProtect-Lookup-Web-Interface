If you'd like to contribute to this project, you may fork this project, make changes, then make a pull request. You may add new features or fix bugs you may find in the project. (There's quite a number of them.)

The code as it stands now looks pretty messy. I will clean the code up and make it more legible. I will also make sure to add more comments all over the project.

If you're in doubt, feel free to open an issue.
